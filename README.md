# ImageSegmentation
Image segmentation for FIB-SEM Cell Microstructure Images using Unet and similarly structured CNNs

See [RunUnet2D.ipynb](https://github.com/aduenner/ImageSegmentation/blob/master/RunUnet2D.ipynb) for how to:
  - Import training data
  - Define a fully paramaterized UNET model
  - Train UNET model
  - Generate sub-images from a large grayscale image
  - Visualize predictions on test data
